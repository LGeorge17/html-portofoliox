<h2>The Best Movies according to George</h2>
            <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
            <h3>1. The Conjuring 1 (2013)</h3>
                <p>This is supposedly based on a true story, which possibly explains why things don t get too extreme. In fact it s a bit slow at times, the script is somewhat clunky, and the lack of a central character makes it hard to engage with. But it does have a few chills for those who like their horror retro-flavoured. </p>
            <h3>2. Insidious: The Red Door (2023)</h3>
                <p>A film that caught my attention. I've seen all the other films and I was looking forward to this film quite a bit. From my point of view it's a good movie, but it has quite a few moments where you get really scared. </p>
            <h3>3. A quiet Place</h3>
                <p>Another film I really liked is this one. A film that captures people trying to survive in a devastated New York. They are being chased by monsters who have only one goal and that is to eliminate them.</p>
